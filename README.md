## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Aaryan!

ðŸŽ“ **Software Engineering Junior @ San JosÃ© State University**  
ðŸ¤– **ML/AI Fellow @ Cornell Techâ€™s Break Through Tech**  
ðŸ“Š **Passionate about building machine learning and data-driven solutions and designing tech that creates real impact**

Iâ€™m currently working on ML pipelines and diving deeper into real-world applications of NLP, computer vision, and deep learning. As a Break Through Tech ML/AI Fellow, Iâ€™ve built 10+ end-to-end models with industry mentorship, turning raw data into insights and performance gains. Earlier this year, I led data operations for the first-ever LinkedIn Campus Ambassador Program in the CSU system, where I designed internal tools that screened 300+ applicants and helped activate 1,200+ students on LinkedIn Learning.

Iâ€™m all about driving impact and enabling meaningful outcomes. I'm looking for opportunities where I can grow as an ML practitioner and engineer. I love caffeine and am always excited to chat! â˜•ðŸ§‹
